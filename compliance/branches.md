## Corporate NMLS

Cliffco, Inc. corporate NMLS: **#65328**. All branch NMLS IDs above are in addition to the corporate number and must be disclosed appropriately per state requirements.

## Implications for the website rebuild

- **6 GBP claim/optimization passes needed** — each open branch is its own local-pack opportunity. Any existing GBP listings for Jamaica, Wantagh, or Orlando should be closed/marked permanently closed.
- **9 branch landing pages** at `/locations/{state}/{metro}/{branch-slug}/`, e.g.:
  - `/locations/new-york/long-island/uniondale-headquarters/`
  - `/locations/new-jersey/branchburg/`
  - `/locations/new-york/queens/jamaica/`
  - `/locations/new-york/long-island/wantagh/`
  - `/locations/new-york/long-island/bay-shore/`
  - `/locations/florida/orlando/`
  - `/locations/florida/fort-lauderdale/`
  - `/locations/arizona/buckeye/`
  - `/locations/minnesota/excelsior/`
- Each branch landing page = LocalBusiness JSON-LD (mortgage subtype) + branch NMLS + branch manager bio + LO list + photos + map.

## Branch-specific compliance notes

- **Florida branches (Orlando and Ft. Lauderdale)** must display the **"Swish Capital, Inc." DBA** on all marketing: landing pages, GBP descriptions, business cards, signage.
- **Arizona (Scottsdale)**: AZ license discrepancy noted — most disclosures show AZ #1045708 (corporate); Julian Giaquinto's disclosure shows AZ #0949291. Verify with Rafe before publishing AZ-licensed-state lists.
- **All branches** display corporate NMLS #65328 plus the branch-level NMLS ID where required by state law.

## Languages spoken

- **Branchburg, NJ**: Christian Soto, Daphne Feliciano — bilingual (English/Spanish)
- **Orlando, FL**: Keyla Cruz, Nadia Geyer Castro, Wenceslao Hernandez Romero, Yaisha Romero, Julia Jorge-Delcarmen — strong bilingual cluster
- **Buckeye, AZ**: Mayra Hernandez — bilingual
